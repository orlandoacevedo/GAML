# Samples

This folder contains all the sample files, which can be either used for testing or templates.

For each specific function, either can be executed by loading the corresponded settingfile or by inputting in the command-line.


For settingfile, < # > is chosen as the comments, except for the 'basis_set' parameter, the first # is not.
By using settingfile, one of the greatest advantages is that you can process different command blocks at the same time.


For the command-line input, please use command `gaml` or `gaml -h` or `gaml [command] -h` to get help information.
