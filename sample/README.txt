This directory contains all the sample files, which can be either used for tests or the templates.

For each specific function, either can be executed by loading the corresponded setting file or by inputing in the command-line.


For the setting file, < # > is chosen as the comments, except for the 'basis_set' parameter, the first # is not.
By using setting file, one of the greatest advantages is that you can process different command blocks at the same time.


For the command-line input, please use command "gaml" or "gaml -h" or "gaml cmd_name -h" to get help information. 


For more detail information, please refer the "doc/" directory.
